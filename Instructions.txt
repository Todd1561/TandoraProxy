This program is used to interface between the pianobar-windows opensource application and any program that can send TCP commands.  
This would generally be useful in a headless home automation A/V setup to bring Pandora to your sound system.  
This application works by leveraging the Telnet server that can be enabled in Windows and remotely starting/sending commands to Pianobar. 
I'll outline the basic steps below to get everything installed.

- Enable the Windows Telnet service (3rd party telnet servers should work, too)
- Set the Telnet service to start automatically in services.msc
- Disable the idle timeout setting by entering "tlntadm.exe config timeoutactive=no" in an elevated command prompt
- Download the latest pianobar-windows build from https://github.com/thedmd/pianobar-windows/releases and save it to a folder along with TandoraProxy.exe
- Start TandoraProxy with the "/help" argument to see the arguments you'll need to specify.
- Remember to open the TCP port you decide to use for TandoraProxy (1561 by default) on any relevant firewalls
- Once the program is running you can send the below commands to control Pianobar.  These are just sent as raw ASCII via TCP.  
	You'll get a response back with the current status of Pianobar/TandoraProxy.

From here you can use whatever language you want that can work with TCP sockets to interace with TandoraProxy/Pianobar.
	
Commands:	
	- "update": have TandoraProxy query pianobar-windows for the current song, station, play time and whether or not playback is active and a list of your Pandora stations.
	- "playpause": toggle playing and pausing music playback.
	- "next": play next song.
	- "thumbsup": like current song.
